## Responsible AI Audit Questionnaire: 

This questionnaire is designed to assess the ethical considerations and potential risks associated with your AI system. Please answer the questions thoughtfully and provide supporting evidence from your project artifacts where indicated.

**Project Information:**

1. **Project Name:**  [Provide the name of your AI project]
2. **Project Description:** [Provide a brief description of the purpose and functionality of your AI system]
3. **Project Team:** [List the key individuals or teams involved in developing and deploying the AI system]

**Data:**

1. **Data Sources:** 
    * List all data sources used to train and evaluate your AI system (e.g., datasets, databases, APIs). 
    * For each data source, specify:
        *  Whether the data is structured or unstructured.
        *  The origin of the data (e.g., publicly available, internally collected, purchased).
        *  Any known biases or limitations in the data.
   **Supporting Evidence:** Provide documentation or links to datasets used (e.g., data cards, data statements).
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Describe the data preprocessing techniques used to clean, transform, or prepare the data for your AI system (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling, data augmentation). 
    * Explain how these techniques might impact fairness and bias.
    **Supporting Evidence:** Provide code snippets or documentation of data preprocessing pipelines.
3. **Data Governance:**
    * Describe the processes and policies in place to ensure responsible data collection, storage, usage, and disposal. 
    * How do you ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?
    **Supporting Evidence:** Provide relevant data governance policies or documentation.

**Model Development and Evaluation:**

1. **Model Choice:**
    * Explain the rationale behind choosing the specific AI model(s) used in your project. 
    * What were the alternative models considered and why were they rejected?
    **Supporting Evidence:**  Provide documentation of model selection process, including comparisons or benchmarks.
2. **Fairness and Bias:**
    * Describe the steps taken to identify and mitigate potential biases in your AI system. 
    * What fairness metrics were used? 
    * How were different demographic groups or subgroups evaluated?
    **Supporting Evidence:**  Provide documentation of bias detection and mitigation techniques, along with fairness metric results.
3. **Explainability and Interpretability:**
    * To what extent is the decision-making process of your AI system explainable and interpretable?
    * What methods were used to provide insights into model predictions?
    **Supporting Evidence:** Provide documentation of explainability techniques used (e.g., SHAP values, LIME).
4. **Robustness and Security:** 
    *  Describe the measures taken to ensure the robustness and security of your AI system, including resilience to adversarial attacks or attempts to manipulate the system.
    **Supporting Evidence:** Provide documentation or test results related to adversarial testing or security assessments. 

**Deployment and Monitoring:**

1. **Human Oversight:**
    * Describe the role of human oversight in the deployment and operation of your AI system. 
    *  Are there human-in-the-loop processes for critical decisions? 
    **Supporting Evidence:**  Provide documentation of human review processes or escalation procedures. 
2. **Monitoring and Auditing:**
    * What mechanisms are in place to monitor the performance and impact of your AI system once deployed? 
    * How frequently are audits conducted to assess for bias, fairness, and unintended consequences?
    **Supporting Evidence:**  Provide monitoring dashboards, audit reports, or documentation of feedback loops.

**Ethical Considerations:**

1. **Societal Impact:**
    * Discuss the potential societal impact of your AI system, both positive and negative. 
    *  Consider the potential for unintended consequences or misuse.
2. **Ethical Principles:**
    * Identify any relevant ethical principles or guidelines (e.g., fairness, accountability, transparency) that informed the development and deployment of your AI system. 
3. **Red Lines:**
    *  Are there specific applications or use cases where the use of your AI system would be deemed unacceptable? If so, please describe these "red lines."

**Additional Information:**

Please provide any additional information or context that you believe is relevant to the responsible AI audit.

**Next Steps:**

Upon completion of the questionnaire, please submit it along with the requested supporting evidence.  The audit team will review the materials and may schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss the findings and recommendations.
